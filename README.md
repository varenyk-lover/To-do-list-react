# To-do list app
Here you can watch it —  https://todo-list-hanna.netlify.app/

Technologies: React, styled-components, prop-types.

Design: responsive for different screen sizes.

Features:
1. Theme toggler that was created with styled-components library.
2. Counter of active and done tasks.
3. Search input to search the task by name. You could search the task in all to-do list by name, then check it as done in its checkbox, then click on "Done" filter button and see it there.
4. Filter buttons — all tasks, active, done.
5. To-do list — you will see it after creating the first task. You could check it as done, edit it or delete. You could click on "Done" filter button, uncheck a few tasks at the same time, and then see them in "Active" tasks.
6. Input to add new tasks. You could add new task from any part of app: in "All" tasks, in "Active" tasks or in "Done". But every added new task is "Active" by default, so it has an unchecked checkbox even if the task was created in "Done" list.

Github: for each task and bug was created a new branch. On the beginning of my mentorship, my mentor was checking each task. If it was ok, then I opened pull request. After it, I needed to merge branch into development.

File structure: Atomic Design methodology.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
